# project_extension
So here we go starting my final project for cs50! My idea at the moment is to create a chrome extension that superimposes quotes/daily motivation into the browser window when prompted or
when a time limit has be hit

I want to use the meditation stick figure I made in Illustrator like the helpful paperclip that Word used to have. But, instead of being annoying it would be more of a browser companion that
would give you a nice motivation quote when clicked. Super simple and straight forward!
